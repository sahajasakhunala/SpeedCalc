OVERVIEW
SpeedCalc is not just a calculator.
It is a reaction-based math battle game designed to improve mental math speed, accuracy, and focus under pressure.

The game challenges you to solve arithmetic problems against the clock while managing lives, streaks, and escalating difficulty. As you improve, the game adapts to push you harder.


WHAT SpeedCalc IS

SpeedCalc is a terminal-based math game that combines:
-Fast-paced arithmetic challenges
-Time pressure
-Streak-based progression
-Boss battles
-A shield (life) system
-Leaderboard tracking
The game runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.


STARTING THE GAME

When the game launches, you will be guided through the setup automatically.
You will be asked to select a game mode before beginning.

2) Hyper-Speed Mode:
Hyper-Speed Mode is designed for experienced players.

-No pause after wrong answer
-Focuses on reaction speed and consistency


HOW A ROUND WORKS

At the start of each round, you are given options:
a) Start a math challenge
b) Quit the game and view the leaderboard
Choosing to start will immediately present a math problem.


ANSWERING QUESTIONS
Each question is displayed clearly on screen.

Important rules:
-Do not type early
-Input is only accepted when prompted
-Type your answer carefully
-Submit your answer once you are finished
Typing before input is enabled may cause incorrect behavior.


DIVISION RULES (Very Important)
Division problems require exact formatting.
-Answers must be rounded to exactly two decimal places
-Even whole-number results must include two decimals
If the format is incorrect, the answer is marked wrong even if the value is correct.


TIME BAR FEEDBACK
After each answer, a visual time bar appears.

The color indicates how fast you responded:
🟢 Green — Very fast
🟡 Yellow — Moderate speed
🔴 Red — Nearly too slow
This helps you understand your reaction speed, not just correctness.


CORRECT ANSWERS
When you answer correctly:
-A confirmation message is shown
-A high-pitched sound plays
-Your streak increases by one
Maintaining streaks is key to progression.


WRONG ANSWERS
When you answer incorrectly:
-An error message is shown
-A low-pitched sound plays
-A shield may absorb the mistake
The game continues as long as you have shields.


TIMEOUTS
If you fail to answer before time runs out:
-The question counts as incorrect
-Shields are affected the same way as a wrong answer


SHIELD SYSTEM
Shields act as extra lives.
-You start with 1 shield
-Maximum shields: 3

When You Make a Mistake
-If you have shields remaining, one shield is consumed
-If you have no shields left:
  -Your streak resets to zero
  -Your score may be recorded on the leaderboard

SHIELD REWARDS
-Every 5 correct answers in a row, you earn one shield
-Shields are only awarded if you are not already at maximum
Consistent performance is rewarded.


BOSS LEVELS
Every 25 correct answers in a row triggers a boss challenge.
Boss challenges include:
-Larger numbers
-Harder operations
-Increased difficulty and pressure

Defeating a Boss
-Instantly restores shields to maximum (3)
Boss levels act as milestones in your run.


LEADERBOARD
-Tracks the top 5 highest streaks
-Scores are saved automatically
-Leaderboard loads every time the game starts
-Displayed when you quit the game
Your best runs are always preserved.


SOUND SYSTEM
The game provides audio feedback:
-Correct answer → high-pitched sound
-Wrong answer → low-pitched sound
The system works across platforms and falls back to standard terminal sounds if needed.


AUTOMATIC DIFFICUTY SCALING
SpeedCalc automatically adapts to your performance.

As your streak increases:
-Numbers become larger
-Multiplication becomes more complex
-Division chains become longer
-Subtraction ranges become smarter
There is no difficulty selection — the game grows with you.


BEHIND-THE-SCENES FEATURES
These systems work automatically and require no setup:
-Cross-platform color support
-Input handling to prevent early typin
-Accurate decimal rounding
-Automatic leaderboard saving
-Safe handling of errors and crashes


FINAL NOTES
SpeedCalc is designed to reward focus, speed, and consistency.
Whether you are training mental math or chasing leaderboard streaks, the challenge always scales to match your skill.

Good luck — and stay sharp.
